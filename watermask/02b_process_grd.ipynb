    "This will use the ESA SNAP GPT tool to create GRD products from the already downloaded SLC imagery. With the GRD data, the Normalized Difference Polarization Index, VV/VH, VH/VV, Normalized VH index, and Normalized VV index will be used to create water masks. Otsu thresholding will be done to label pixels as subaqeuous or subaerial.\n",
