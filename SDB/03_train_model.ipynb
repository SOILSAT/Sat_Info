    "This notebook will be used to develop and compare regression models to correlate the eHydro bathymetric surveys with cloud-masked Sentinel-2 surface refelctances. These models will hopefully provide USACE and the eHydro program with a new, robust, accurate tool for unmanned bathymetric estiamtes. This will be possible at 10-meter resolution at a frequency of up to 5 days.\n",
